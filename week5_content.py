<h1><strong>MCM 307: Media Ethics | Week 5</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Ads & Sponsorships — The FTC Rules</p>
<p><strong>Theme:</strong> "Getting Paid" vs. "Getting Played"</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Part I: The Study Pack</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1. The Hook: "The Invisible Ad"</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> When you watch a YouTuber drink a certain energy drink for 30 seconds mid-video, is that a personal choice or a paid placement? If you can't tell, that's the ethical issue. The FTC calls it "deceptive advertising."</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Rule:</strong> If there is a "material connection" between you and a brand (money, free products, even friendship), you MUST disclose it clearly. Not buried in hashtags. Not in tiny text. <strong>Clearly.</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Resource:</strong> <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers" target="_blank">FTC: Disclosures 101 for Social Media Influencers (Official Guide)</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2. Case Study: Kim Kardashian & EthereumMax ($1.26 Million Lesson)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Scene:</strong> In 2021, Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram story promoting "EthereumMax" (EMAX), a cryptocurrency. The post said "This is not financial advice" but did NOT say she was paid $250,000 to post it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Fallout:</strong> The SEC charged her with violating securities laws. She paid $1.26 million in penalties and agreed not to promote crypto for 3 years.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> "This is not financial advice" is NOT a disclosure. The audience needs to know you got paid. Period.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>3. Case Study: The CSGO Lotto Scandal (Owning the Casino)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Scene:</strong> YouTubers TmarTn and ProSyndicate made videos gambling on CSGO Lotto, a Counter-Strike skin betting website. They won big. They acted surprised. They told their audiences to try it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> They OWNED the website. They never disclosed it. They were literally telling kids to gamble at their own casino while pretending to be customers.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Question:</strong> Is this a failure of disclosure, or is it fraud?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8fU2QG-lV0" target="_blank">h3h3Productions: Deception, Lies, and CSGO</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>4. The "#Ad" vs. "#Sponsored" vs. Nothing Game</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Trick:</strong> Some influencers bury disclosures in hashtag soup: "#blessed #ad #fitness #grind #sponsored #love". The FTC says this is NOT clear disclosure.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Standard:</strong> Disclosure must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the BEGINNING (not after "See More")</li>
<li>In PLAIN language ("Ad" or "Paid Partnership")</li>
<li>UNAVOIDABLE (not hidden in 30 hashtags)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Platform Tools:</strong> Instagram's "Paid Partnership" tag exists for a reason. YouTube's "Includes Paid Promotion" checkbox exists for a reason. Use them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-x8DYTOv7w" target="_blank">Philip DeFranco: The Problem With Influencer Ads</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>5. The Black Creator Reality Check</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Context:</strong> Black creators are statistically offered fewer sponsorships AND lower rates than white creators with the same follower counts. This creates pressure to take bad deals or skip disclosures to seem "organic."</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Trap:</strong> When you finally get a brand deal, the temptation to hide the #ad (so it performs better) is real. But getting caught destroys your credibility AND can result in FTC action.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Standard:</strong> Your integrity is worth more than one check. If a brand asks you to hide the sponsorship, that brand is asking you to break the law for them. Walk away.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Part II: Key Concepts to Know</strong></h2>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8">
<tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Material Connection</strong></td><td>Any relationship that might affect the credibility of your endorsement (money, free stuff, family, employment)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Clear and Conspicuous</strong></td><td>FTC standard: disclosure must be impossible to miss</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Native Advertising</strong></td><td>Ads designed to look like regular content (articles, posts, videos)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Affiliate Link</strong></td><td>A trackable link that pays you commission — still requires disclosure</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Gifted Product</strong></td><td>Free product sent by a brand — still requires disclosure if you post about it</td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Part III: The "Can vs. Should" Summary</strong></h2>

<p><strong>CAN you hide a sponsorship if the brand asks?</strong> Technically, some people do it.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD you?</strong> No. It's illegal (FTC), unethical (audience trust), and career-ending if exposed.</p>

<p><strong>CAN you bury #ad in 30 hashtags?</strong> Technically possible.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD you?</strong> No. The FTC explicitly says this doesn't count as disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>CAN you promote a product you own without saying so?</strong> You can try.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD you?</strong> Ask TmarTn how that worked out.</p>
