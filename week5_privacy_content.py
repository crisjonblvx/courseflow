<h1><strong>MCM 307: Media Ethics | Week 5</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Privacy — The Entitlement of Filming</p>
<p><strong>Theme:</strong> "Your Content" vs. "Their Consent"</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Part I: The Study Pack</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1. The Hook: "Main Character Syndrome"</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Social media has convinced a generation that they are the main character and everyone else is a background extra. This mindset leads to filming strangers without consent, getting angry when people "ruin" your shot, and treating public spaces like personal studios.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Term:</strong> "Main Character Syndrome" — the belief that your content matters more than other people's comfort, privacy, or dignity.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOUIIv-ZyjM" target="_blank">Joey Swoll: "Harassed by the Man in the Background?!"</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2. Case Study: The Gym Content Wars</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Scene:</strong> A fitness influencer sets up a tripod at a commercial gym. A stranger walks through the shot. The influencer posts the video calling them a "creep" for being in the background. Joey Swoll responds.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Reality Check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A gym membership rents you access to EQUIPMENT, not exclusive use of SPACE.</li>
<li>Other members have equal right to exist in that space.</li>
<li>Filming someone without consent and mocking them online is harassment — even if they "walked through your shot."</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> If you want a private studio, build one. Don't expect the world to freeze for your content.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>3. The Law: Public vs. Private Space</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Public Space (The Sidewalk):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have a First Amendment right to film anything visible from a public place.</li>
<li>No "expectation of privacy" on a public street.</li>
<li>This is why paparazzi can legally photograph celebrities in public.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Private Property Open to the Public (The Gym, Store, Restaurant):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OWNER sets the rules, not you.</li>
<li>If the gym says "No tripods," and you use one, you can be removed for trespassing.</li>
<li>"But I pay a membership!" — You pay for access, not ownership.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>The Hard Line (Bathrooms, Locker Rooms, Bedrooms):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is ALWAYS an expectation of privacy where people undress.</li>
<li>Filming in these spaces is a CRIME — not just unethical, illegal.</li>
<li>This includes hidden cameras, "accidental" recordings, and even audio.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNwKXDtXWHo" target="_blank">Ask a Lawyer: Public vs. Private Filming Rights</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>4. Case Study: "Shaming" Content</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Trend:</strong> Filming strangers at the gym to mock their form, their outfit, their body — then posting it for engagement. Sometimes millions of views.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Victim:</strong> A person who was just trying to work out, now humiliated in front of millions. They didn't consent. They didn't know. They can't fight back.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Ethics:</strong> Even if it's "legal" to film in some spaces, weaponizing that footage to mock strangers is a choice. Your engagement is built on someone else's humiliation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> Multiple influencers have been banned from gyms (and the entire gym chain) for this behavior. Some have faced lawsuits.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>5. Digital Privacy: Beyond the Camera</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Doxxing:</strong> Publishing someone's private information (address, phone, workplace) to enable harassment. This has led to swatting incidents, job losses, and even deaths.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Non-Consensual Intimate Images:</strong> Sharing private photos/videos without consent. Now illegal in most states. Careers and lives destroyed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The "Screenshot Culture":</strong> Private DMs posted publicly as "receipts." Legal? Usually. Ethical? Depends on context. Betrayal of trust? Always.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAYK1CqdYyc" target="_blank">Hasan Piker: The Dangers of Doxxing Culture</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>6. The Black Community & Surveillance</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The History:</strong> Before influencers filmed strangers for content, the state filmed Black people for control. COINTELPRO. Stop and frisk. "Suspicious activity" reports. The Black body has always been surveilled.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Modern Version:</strong> "Karen" videos that call cops on Black people for existing in public spaces. Ring doorbell footage posted to Nextdoor with racist commentary. Viral videos of Black people in "suspicious" situations that turn out to be nothing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Question:</strong> When you pull out your phone to film a stranger, ask yourself: Am I documenting injustice, or am I participating in surveillance culture?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/06/racist-history-of-surveillance-in-america/612856/" target="_blank">The Atlantic: The Racist History of American Surveillance</a></p></li>

<h2><strong>Part II: Key Concepts</strong></h2>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8">
<tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Expectation of Privacy</strong></td><td>Legal standard: Would a reasonable person expect privacy in this situation?</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Main Character Syndrome</strong></td><td>Believing your content needs are more important than others' rights</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Shaming Content</strong></td><td>Filming strangers to mock them for engagement</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Doxxing</strong></td><td>Publishing private info to enable harassment</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Consent</strong></td><td>Permission — just because you CAN film doesn't mean you SHOULD</td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Part III: The "Can vs. Should" Summary</strong></h2>

<p><strong>CAN you film someone at the gym without asking?</strong> Depends on gym policy and state law.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD you?</strong> Not if they're going to be identifiable in content they didn't consent to.</p>

<p><strong>CAN you post a video mocking a stranger's workout form?</strong> Probably legal.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD you?</strong> No. Your engagement isn't worth their humiliation.</p>

<p><strong>CAN you screenshot and post private DMs?</strong> Usually legal.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD you?</strong> Only if there's a genuine public interest (abuse, threats, scams) — not for clout.</p>
